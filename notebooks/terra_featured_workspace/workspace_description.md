# Use ml4cvd to review and annotate machine learning results

In this Terra workspace we demonstrate the notebooks used by clinicians and researchers to review and annotate both model inputs, such as phenotypes, ECGs and MRIs, and model outputs such as predicted left ventricular mass.

`ml4cvd` is a project aimed at using machine learning to model multi-modal cardiovascular
time series and imaging data. `ml4cvd` began as a set of tools to make it easy to work
with the UK Biobank on Google Cloud Platform and has since expanded to include other data sources
and functionality. 

Please see https://github.com/broadinstitute/ml/ for more details on the full project.

----------------------------
## How long will it take to run? How much will it cost?
**Time:** It takes 1 minute to run each notebook. Spend as much or as little time as you like using the interactive visualizations to explore the data.

**Cost:** Using the default notebook configuration, the Terra notebook runtime charges are $0.20/hour for Google Cloud service costs. It should cost less than a quarter to run the notebooks.

----------------------------
## Get Started

1. Clone this workspace.
1. From the preview view of one of the notebooks
    1. Copy the Terra custom Docker image name
    1. Click on `Notebook Runtime`
    1. Choose `Environment -> Custom Environment`
    1. Paste the Docker image name `Container Image`
    1. Click on the `Replace` button
1. Run the notebooks in "Playground Mode" to explore model inputs and outputs.
