# Machine learning on >40,000 body MRIs and fat distribution

1. Ingest the provided whole-body MRI `zip` files using `ingest.py`
2. Compute the 2D projections using the ingested 3D volumes with `compute_projections.py`
3. Train deep learning-based model(s) using `train.py`
4. Phenotype characterization and disease association with `downstream_associations_v2.ipynb`
